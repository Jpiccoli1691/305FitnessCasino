## Fitness Casino

Modern fitness apps excel at tracking progress but often lack engaging user interaction or meaningful rewards for achievements. Imagine hiking over 10 miles or achieving new personal bests, only to receive a generic "Great Job!" message. Our project aims to transform fitness tracking by integrating fun, interactive elements inspired by casino gaming.

## Features:
- **Gamified Fitness Tracking:** Earn in-game tokens based on calories burned.
- **Casino Games:** Enjoy slot machines, roulettes, and blackjack using earned tokens.
- **Virtual Economy:** Use game earnings for cosmetic items like character clothes, jewelry, and more.
- **Luxury Tax:** Weekly tax on owned items; manage finances or face consequences.
- **Borrowing Option:** Take loans from the casino; repay or risk losing purchased items.
