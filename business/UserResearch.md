## Observation 1:
[//]: (Jonathan)
**Observation Statement:**  
*Observed the fact that our survey was directed towards possibly the wrong targeted group because half the data returned was " we do not use a fitness app." *

**Supporting Data:**  
- *over 50% of the user data reflected people do not use fitness apps*

**Team Action (if any):**  
- *Possible an expanded survey towards more people*
