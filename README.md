Fitness Casino:

Modern fitness apps are great for tracking fitness progress and visualizing data such as heart rate, calories burned, miles walked, etc... However, most apps provide very little user interaction or reward for progress or personal bests. Imagine hiking over 10 miles, setting fastest laps, or hitting new personal records and all the app rewards you with is a "Great Job!" message or an in-app achievement badge. 
For our software development project, we wanted to make an app would reward a user, based off fitness data, with fun user interaction through games and virtual gambling. 
All in-game currency will be based off a transfer rate for calories burned to in-game tokens.
In-game currency will then be used to play casino games, such as slot machines, roulettes, and blackjack games.
Any money earned from these games can then be used for purely cosmetic in-game items, such as clothes for your character, jewelry, cars, luxury items, etc...
Keeping in mind that this is a Fitness "CASINO," there may be a weekly luxury tax, based on owned items, and also an option to borrow money from the casino. If a user finds themselves indebted to the casino, their in-game purchases can be reposessed until their debts have been paid.
