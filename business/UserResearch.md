## Observation 2:
[//]: (Mani)
**Observation Statement:**  
*Observed that the majority of people are more interested by the 'casino' aspect than the fitness aspect of our app*

**Supporting Data:**  
- *over 40% of the users voted on a 'Dark and underground casino-like' theme for our UI design*

- *Make sure the UI design stick to the casino theme, and make every fitness feature consequential to our casino game*
